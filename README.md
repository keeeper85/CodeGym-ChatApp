# CodeGym-ChatApp
Project at the end of level 27. Server-Client chat application (see readme).

So let's recap: • You wrote a text messaging server. • You wrote a console-based client that can connect to the server and exchange messages with other chat participants. • You wrote a bot client that can receive requests and send information about the current date and time. • You wrote a chat client with a graphical interface.
Here are some things you might add or improve: • You could add support for private messages (when a message is sent to a specific participant instead of everyone). • You could extend the bot's capabilities. Try to teach it to respond to super simple questions or to make jokes from time to time. • Add the ability to transfer files between users. • Add a context menu to the GUI-based client, for example, to send a private message to someone from a list of participants. • Color the messages in the GUI-based client, depending on the sender. • Add the ability for the server to block participants, for example, for offensive language in messages. • Add another million features and abilities!
You learned how to: • Work with sockets. • Use serialization and deserialization. • Create and synchronize multi-threaded applications, use the volatile modifier, and use classes from the java.util.concurrent library. • Apply the MVC pattern. • Use inner and nested classes. • Work with the Swing library. • Use the Calendar and SimpleDateFormat classes.
